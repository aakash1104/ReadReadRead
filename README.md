## Read, Read, Read, ... ##

This repository is to help me keep track of research papers that I have read and
papers that I am yet to finish reading. Ideally, every single paper that I read
should be summarized in at least a paragraph to help me remember what I got out
of reading that paper.

Most of these papers will be focused on Theoretical Computer Science especially
algorithms, complexity theory, and optimization.
